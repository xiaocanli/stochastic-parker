Welcome to stochastic-parker's documentation!
===================================

**stochastic-parker**  is a Fortran program for solving the Parker's transport equation (and its extensions) using the stochastic method. It uses MHD simulation data (magnetic field, velocity, density) as background to evolve the transport equation. It has been used in studying particle acceleration and transport in magnetic reconnection, solar flares, and solar eruption regions.

Check out the :doc:`install` on how to install the program and :doc:`usage` section for how to run the program.
